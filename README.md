This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## First View

This is the page which will greet you, it is fully responsive and has a dark mode and light mode switch as well.

## Using Contentful CMS

I used Contentful for the CMS integration, and added a page called 'Features' which can be navigated by click on 'See More' at the end of the home page

Which brings us to a list of Features which are being fetched from Contentful

Each of these Features can be viewed in a single page with more detail when clicked on it (WIP)
